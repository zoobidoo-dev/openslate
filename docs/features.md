# Features

## Rich Text Editor

OpenSlate uses the **Tiptap** editor (built on ProseMirror) with full rich text support.

### Text Formatting

- **Bold**, *Italic*, ~~Strikethrough~~, <u>Underline</u>, `Code`, <mark>Highlight</mark>
- Headings 1–3
- Bullet lists, ordered lists, task lists (`- [ ]`)
- Blockquotes, horizontal rules, code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Links
- Tables with row/column add/delete

### Markdown Support

The editor exports/imports markdown via `tiptap-markdown`. You can paste markdown text and it will be converted to rich text, and vice versa.

### File Handling
